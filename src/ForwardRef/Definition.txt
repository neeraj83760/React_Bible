Ye samjhlo ki ye useRef ka hi advance version hai 

hum useRef mai ye kar rahe the ki html elements ki properties change 
kar rahe the ek button ki clicking par which we can also say that 
we were modifying DOM on a button click but what happens when the 
button and the respective HTMl elements are in diff diff components so 
in that case how we will MOdify DOM ...here comes ForwardRef to rescue ...
hum isse use karke as a props pass karenge from one component to another
